    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Welcome to this website. This is the home page. You can tell that it's the home page since, much like you pantry at home, it's somehow filled, yet void of anything worthwhile. Maybe it should instead be called the Pantry page. Either way, it doesn't matter. All of this is just useless information to fill up the page to make it look better. Thanks for reading to the end.</p>
